EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM:
To run the program, we have to type the command 
	javac HA02G11_1.java			: to compile the program 
	java HA02G11_1				: to execute the program 

DESCRIPTION:
1) The main() method reads a file, fetches data and stores the inputs into various arrays. It also accepts the minimum profit to be achieved and 
   calculates the target profit.
2) The method bubblesort() takes the profit array, index array and number of events as input, sorts them in ascending order of profit, also indices
   respectively.

CHALLENGES/ISSUES:
We are not able to dynamically pass the name of a string while reading inputs from a file. Rest all is perfectly working. But not able to fetch the
output as we are not able to read the arrays dynamically.
